I am an FPV flying enthusiast, but after years of flying, I feel a little tired of it, so I thought about doing something. I thought this kind of FPV flying machine would be very interesting when it flies, so I drew a 3D design drawing of it. This FPV flying machine will use duct as power, and thanks to its powerful power and this aerodynamic shape, it should have a very high speed when it flies.
If you choose a not-so-large ducted propeller, such as about 70 ducts or even smaller, to make this aircraft, it is sufficient to use PETG-CF material to 3D print some parts. Of course, don't forget to use carbon fiber tubes as the main force-bearing structure.
这些stl零件适配于怪象35圈圈机的改装，添加他们到你的飞机上可以让你感受到不一样的fpv体验，请注意，这些stl格式的文件仅仅是这种气动套件的主机翼部分，他们使用4mm 3mm 2mm的碳纤维杆作为加强，其余的文件已经在dwg文件中了，如果需要为了适配怪象35，把文件中的尺寸需要缩小到0.75.
