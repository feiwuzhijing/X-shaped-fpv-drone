I am an FPV flying enthusiast, but after years of flying, I feel a little tired of it, so I thought about doing something. I thought this kind of FPV flying machine would be very interesting when it flies, so I drew a 3D design drawing of it. This FPV flying machine will use duct as power, and thanks to its powerful power and this aerodynamic shape, it should have a very high speed when it flies.
If you choose a not-so-large ducted propeller, such as about 70 ducts or even smaller, to make this aircraft, it is sufficient to use PETG-CF material to 3D print some parts. Of course, don't forget to use carbon fiber tubes as the main force-bearing structure.
